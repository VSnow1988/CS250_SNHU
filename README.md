# CS250_SNHU
SNHU CS-250: Software Development Lifecycle

In this course I studied and practiced a simulation of a corporate team environment, learned industry terms, commonly used charts and organization methods, and the Agile development method.
I learned the importance of flexibility, thorough planning, an accurate collection of client needs and requirements, and communication between stakeholders and team members to finish a quality product as quickly as possible that thoroughly satisfies the customer.

## Final Project

The class projects included actual work on a Java desktop application for a fictional travel company, but focused on the Agile team process. The assignments turned in include a test case spreadsheet, emails to the team leader after reviewing the application, reviewing a design requirements document and flowcharts, and writing a review at the end of the project sprint.
