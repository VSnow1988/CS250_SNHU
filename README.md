# CS250_SNHU
SNHU CS-250: Software Development Lifecycle

In this course I studied and practiced a simulation of a corporate team environment, learned industry terms, commonly used charts and organization methods, and the Agile development method.
I learned the importance of flexibility, thorough planning, an accurate collection of client needs and requirements, and communication between stakeholders and team members to finish a quality product as quickly as possible that thoroughly satisfies the customer.
